            <h1>What is Java?</h1>
            <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.</p>
            <p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>
            <p><b> Platform:</b> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>
            <h1>Application</h1>
            <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
                <li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
                <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
                <li>Mobile</li>
                <li>Embedded System</li>
                <li>Smart Card</li>
                <li>Robotics</li>
                <li>Games,etc!</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>Types of Java Applications</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Standalone Application</li>
                <p>Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</p>
                <li>Web Application</li>
                <p>An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</p>
                <li>Enterprise Application</li>
                <p>An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise application</p>
                <li>Mobile Application</li>
                <p>An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.</p>

            <h1>History of Java</h1>
            <p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>
            <p>The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.</p>
            <p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.</li>
                <li>Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</li>
                <li>Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt</li>
                <li>After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.</li>
                <li>Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.</li>
                <li>in 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.</li>
                <li>Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.</li>
                <li>Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.</li>
